# BandMetronome
Not so simple metronome for band. You can add and edit many bands and sets for each band. Each set contains music pieces with their name, tempo and metrum.
You can edit some elements directly from player.

# Known issues
Main issue is that javascript has problems with time. Periods are not equal so clicks given by app sometimes delay or haste and because of this problem the metronome is useless. It's more for show.
